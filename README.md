Program Purpose: The purpose of this program is to create dictionaries containing suits and values for a card deck, and to translate codons to protein sequences. 

Inputs:
codon_code
run_again
'l' for protein length
'c' for common occuring codons

Expected Output:
should provide the user with the specified dictionaries for suits to values, and values to suits. 
Should return the translated protein sequence:
if user enters 'l': should return the length of the sequence
if user enters 'c': should return the most commonly occuring codon, and the number of times it occuredin the translated sequence.
if user enters 'b': should preform both of the above actions.


Types of execution:

Repeated execution: For and while loops to repeat parts of the program if desired. 
Sequential execution: User-defined functions are to execute from top to bottom. 
Conditional execution: If else and while loops to determine if the program re-executes.
Reusable: User-defined functions may be reused inside or outside of the program.

Possible Improvements:
1. Add an option for user to enter values into the card dictionaries or add option for user to access specific dictionaries and values using keys.
2. Not sure if all the biology content is correct, had to look it up.
3. I do not think the card dictionaries are indexed correctly, should start at value = 1 instead of value = 2.
